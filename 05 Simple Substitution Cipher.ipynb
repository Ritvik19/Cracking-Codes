    "# Hacking Simple Substitution Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple substitution cipher is impossible to crack using brute force because it has too many possible keys. To hack the simple substitution cipher, we need to create a more sophisticated program that uses dictionary values to map the potential decryption letters of a ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brute-force attacks, we try each possible key to check whether it can decrypt the ciphertext. If the key is correct, the decryption results in readable English. But by analyzing the ciphertext first, we can reduce the number of possible keys to try and maybe even find a full or partial key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the original plaintext consists mostly of words in an English dictionary file, like the one we used in Chapter 11. Although a ciphertext won’t be made of real English words, it will still contain groups of letters broken up by spaces, just like words in regular sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each plaintext letter can encrypt to only one cipherletter, and we’re not encrypting spaces in this version of the cipher, the plaintext and ciphertext will share the same word patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had the plaintext MISSISSIPPI SPILL, the corresponding ciphertext might be RJBBJBBJXXJ BXJHH. The number of letters in the first word of the plaintext and the first cipherword are the same. The same is true for the second plaintext word and the second cipher­word. The plaintext and ciphertext share the same pattern of letters and spaces. Also notice that letters that repeat in the plaintext repeat the same number of times and in the same places as the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could therefore assume that a cipherword corresponds to a word in the English dictionary file and that their word patterns would match. Then, if we can find which word in the dictionary the cipherword decrypts to, we can figure out the decryption of each cipherletter in that word. And if we figure out enough cipherletter decryptions using this technique, we may be able to decrypt the entire message."

    "## Finding Word Patterns\n",
    "Let’s examine the word pattern of the cipherword HGHHU. You can see that the cipherword has certain characteristics, which the original plaintext word must share. Both words must have the following in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They should be five letters long.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first, third, and fourth letters should be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They should have exactly three different letters; the first, second, and fifth letters should all be different.\n",

    "Let’s think of words in the English language that fit this pattern. Puppy is one such word, which is five letters long (P, U, P, P, Y) and uses three different letters (P, U, Y) arranged in that same pattern (P for the first, third, and fourth letter; U for the second letter; and Y for the fifth letter). Mommy, bobby, lulls, and nanny fit the pattern, too. These words, along with any other word in the English dictionary file that matches the criteria, are all possible decryptions of HGHHU.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a word pattern in a way the program can understand, we’ll make each pattern into a set of numbers separated by periods that indicates the pattern of letters.\n",

    "Creating word patterns is easy: the first letter gets the number 0, and the first occurrence of each different letter thereafter gets the next number. For example, the word pattern for cat is 0.1.2, and the word pattern for classification is 0.1.2.3.3.4.5.4.0.2.6.4.7.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple substitution ciphers, no matter which key is used to encrypt, a plaintext word and its cipherword always have the same word pattern. The word pattern for the cipherword HGHHU is 0.1.0.0.2, which means the word pattern of the plaintext corresponding to HGHHU is also 0.1.0.0.2."
